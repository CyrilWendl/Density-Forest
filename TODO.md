# To Do

## Code
- Change code to PyTorch
- Implement OA / AA accuracy
- Test with Euclidian Distance to Cluster Centers

## Ideas
- Patches: test all classes
- Adapt loss function? https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09844
- Apply to active learning (seen classes)
- Take into account density forest prediction variability

## Baseline Methods
- Confidence from Invariance to Image Transformations: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00657
- Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142

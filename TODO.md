# To Do
## General
- Patches: test all classes, compare euclidean to PDF
- Change code to PyTorch 
- Adapt loss function, https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09844
- Apply to active learning (seen classes)
- Take into account density forest prediction variability
- Baseline Methods
    - Confidence from Invariance to Image Transformations: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00657
    - Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142
- Split Criterion: Nb. points > dimensions, tree height

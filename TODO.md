# To Do
- Refine cross-validation for all methods
- Export hyperparameters for each class
- Make runnable scripts from notebooks
- Clean up code and folder structure 

### Density Forests
- Why does it work significantly better with lower dimensions?
- Influence of fact_improvement (should be always >1)?
- Subsample all classes equally for training DF?

# To Do

## Code
- Change code to PyTorch
- Implement OA / AA accuracy

## Ideas
- Retrieve activation weights of all up-sampling layers
- Apply to active learning
- Harness variance of clusters in pixel values? 
    - Make several predictions for same network / train several networks 
    - weight accuracy by variance
- Adapt loss function? Cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09844
- Test method on patch classification task?

# To Do

## Ideas
- Rewrite U-Net in PyTorch for Dropout
- Use results of pre-softmax activations * w to predict same / different outcome on class
- Use parametric t-SNE for dimensionality reduction

## Density Forests
- Why does it work significantly better with lower dimensions?
- Subsample all classes equally for training DF?

## Folder structure
- Put all libraries in same subfolder
- Document functions

## Report
- Compare single tree to Density Forest

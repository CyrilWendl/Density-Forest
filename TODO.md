# To Do

## Ideas
- Rewrite CNN in PyTorch for Dropout
- Use results of pre-softmax activations * w to predict same / different outcome on class
- Use parametric t-SNE for dimensionality reduction

## Folder structure
- Put all libraries in same subfolder

## Report
- Compare single tree to Density Forest

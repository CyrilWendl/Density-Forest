# To Do

## Ideas
- PyTorch
    - Create all CNN models
    - Avoid overfitting, improve accuracy
    - Use results of pre-softmax activations * w to predict same / different outcome on class
    - MC-Dropout
    - Apply DF to other dataset, e.g., CIFAR10


## Report
- Compare single tree to density forest
- Discussion per class

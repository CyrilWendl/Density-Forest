# To Do
- Zurich ND
    - Export accuracy metrics for ND
    - Recalculate min_subset for classes 1-5
    
- Clean up code and library folder structure
- Export hyperparameters for each class
- Rewrite U-Net in PyTorch for Dropout

### Density Forests
- Why does it work significantly better with lower dimensions?
- Subsample all classes equally for training DF?

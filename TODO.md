# To Do

## Code
- Change code to PyTorch
- Implement OA / AA accuracy

## Ideas
- Test on all layers
- Test method on patch classification task?
- Retrieve activation weights of all up-sampling layers
- Adapt loss function? Cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09844
- Apply to active learning (seen classes)

## Baseline Methods
- Confidence from Invariance to Image Transformations: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00657
- Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142

## Report

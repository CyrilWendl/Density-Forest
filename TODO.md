# To Do

### Baseline Methods 
- Implement 3b - Confidence estimation in Neural Networks.pdf
- Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142


### Ideas 
- Account for prediction variability
- Apply to active learning (seen classes)

### Density Forests
- Subsample all classes equally for training DF?

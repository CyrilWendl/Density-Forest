# To Do

## Ideas
- Use results of pre-softmax activations * w to predict same / different outcome on class
- Redo parameter search
- Color scheme for figures
- Intermediate layer in hypercolumn
- Apply DF to other dataset

## Report
- Compare single tree to density forest
- Discussion per class
- CNN tables in appendix, figure U-Net
- Show other novelties: tennis courts etc.

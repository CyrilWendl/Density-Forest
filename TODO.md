# To Do

## General 
- Take into account density forest prediction variability
- Baseline Methods
    - Confidence from Invariance to Image Transformations: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00657
    - Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142

## Ideas 
- Change Code to PyTorch
- Adapt loss function, https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09844
- Apply to active learning (seen classes)

# To Do
- Refine cross-validation for all methods
- Implement k-fold cv in cross-validation
- `min_subset` parameter should lead to at most 1/`min_subset` clusters
- Export hyperparameters for each class
- Make runnable scripts from notebooks
- Clean up code and folder structure
- Rewrite U-Net in PyTorch for Dropout

### Density Forests
- Why does it work significantly better with lower dimensions?
- Subsample all classes equally for training DF?
